        Introduction
        ------------
        
        NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP (Usenet) servers.
        Since NZB is XML-based, it's relatively easy to build one-off parsers to parse
        NZB files.  This project is an attempt to consolidate those many one-off NZB
        parsers into one simple interface.
        
        This package includes three implementations: one based on expat, another based
        on ElementTree, and a final implementation based on lxml.  The order in which
        they were listed is in order of compatibility.  The expat version should work on
        all versions of Python > 2.0, the lxml one will work on all versions > 2.5, and
        lxml will only work if you have lxml installed.
        
        
        A Note on Installing lxml
        -------------------------
        
        While lxml is not a requirement, I have had a hard time installing lxml in the
        past.  I have found this set of commands to work perfectly:
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            STATIC_DEPS=true easy_install 'lxml>=2.2beta4'
            STATIC_DEPS=true sudo easy_install 'lxml>=2.2beta4'

        Accessing the Default Parser
        ============================
        
        Simply import nzb_parser from the pynzb package.  It's an instantiated version
        of the fastest available parser that your system can support.
        
        
        Other Parser Locations
        ======================
        
        ``ExpatNZBParser``:
            Available in the ``pynzb.expat_nzb`` namespace.
        
        ``ETreeNZBParser``:
            Available in the ``pynzb.etree_nzb`` namespace.
        
        ``LXMLNZBParser``:
            Available in the ``pynzb.lxml_nzb`` namespace.
        
        
        Using the NZB Parser
        ====================
        
        If you're using a specific parser, like the ``ETreeNZBParser``, you will first
        have to instantiate it:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            nzb_parser = ETreeNZBParser()
        
        
        Otherwise, you can just import the default parser for your system:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            from pynzb import nzb_parser
        
        
        Then, simply call the ``parse`` method, giving it the xml string as the only
        argument:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            files = nzb_parser.parse('<?xml ... my nzb file here ... </nzb>')
        
        
        This will return a list of ``NZBFiles`` for you to use.
        
        
        NZBFile Objects
        ===============
        
        All of the parsers return ``NZBFile`` objects, which are objects with the
        following properties:
        
        ``poster``:
            The name of the user who posted the file to the newsgroup.
        
        ``date``:
            A ``datetime.date`` representation of when the server first saw the file.
        
        ``subject``:
            The subject used when the user posted the file to the newsgroup.
        
        ``groups``:
            A list of strings representing the newsgroups in which this file may be
            found.
        
        ``segments``:
            A list of ``NZBSegment`` objects talking about where to get the contents
            of this file.
        
        
        NZBSegment Objects
        ==================
        
        Each ``NZBFile`` has a list of ``NZBSegment`` objects, which include information
        on how to retrieve a part of a file.  Here's what you can find on an
        ``NZBSegment`` object:
        
        ``number``:
            The number of the segment in the list of files.
        
        ``bytes``:
            The size of the segment, in bytes.
        
        ``message_id``:
            The Message-ID of the segment (useful for retrieving the full contents)
        
        
        Example
        --------
        
        In this example, we will grab an Ubuntu NZB and parse the file, printing out
        some information about each file and its segments.
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            from pynzb import nzb_parser
            from urllib2 import urlopen
        
            # Grab a sample Ubuntu NZB
            ubuntu_nzb = urlopen('http://media.eflorenzano.com/misc/sample-ubuntu-nzb.nzb').read()
        
            # Parse the NZB into files
            files = nzb_parser.parse(ubuntu_nzb)
        
            # Print out each file's subject and the first two segment message ids
            for nzb_file in files:
                print nzb_file.subject
                for segment in nzb_file.segments[:2]:
                    print '    ' + segment.message_id
                if len(nzb_file.segments) > 2:
                    print '    ...'
